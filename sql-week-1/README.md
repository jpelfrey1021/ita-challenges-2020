# SQL â€“ Week 1 Challenges
For these challenges, you'll find starter files marked with the name of the challenge itself. 

## 1. CREATE (Hiring)
### Task
For this challenge, you need to create a table and add data to it.

### To-do
* Create a table called `employees` with:
  * `employee_id` as an `INT` (make sure this can never been `null` and that it auto increments)
  * `last_name` as a string of characters that can be up to 255 characters long
  * `first_name` as a string of characters that can be up to 255 characters long
* Insert into the table one record of an employee. The data can be anything, just make sure that it is the correct data type.
* Create a `SELECT` statement that retrieves everything from the `employees` table

### Table Schemas
#### employees 
##### Employees at your new company
| NAME          | TYPE                              |

## 2. ORDER BY (Happy Birthday)
### Task
For this challenge, you are given a table of student birthdays with their name, the month number of their birthday and the day number of their birthday.

### To-do
* Create a `SELECT` statement that uses `ORDER BY` statement to organize the birthdays in sequential order
* The resulting query should have two columns: student and their birthday
  * For birthday, you need to concatenate the month and day with a dash(-) between them.
  * Ex. If you have 1 for the month and 4 for the day, your result should be "1-4"

For this challenge, you are given a table of customers with an id, name, and address.

### To-do
* Create a `SELECT` statement that uses wildcards and the `LIKE` statement to get the customers who live in apartments (Apt.)
  * **HINT:** If you want to see the data on the table, just use `SELECT * FROM customers`
* Resulting query should only have the customer's name and address

## 4. DISTINCT (Unique Customers)
### Task
For this challenge, you are given a table with a week's worth of transactions. Each transaction consists of a customer id, price of the item, and a card number used in the transaction.

## 5. GROUP/ORDER BY (Counting Cats)
### Task
For this challenge, you are given a table of cats with an id, name, and age of the cats.

### To-do
* Create a `GROUP BY` statement to group all the cats by their age and count the cats who have the same age

## 6. MAX (Super Score)
### Task
For this challenge, you are given a table of ACT scores. Each row consists of the id of the student who took the test and the score they got on that test. Students are allowed to take the test multiple times and use the best score they got.

### To-do
